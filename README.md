This is team3umd's deliverable for University of Maryland's Fall 2024 Innovation Hack Week Event, hosted by Northrop Grumman.

### About
This program allows users to determine an efficient pathing for any number of UAVs to cover a specified area. This area is intended to be convex, though if the Ear Clipping option is enabled, then concave areas are able to be searched as well (though this comes with a loss in efficiency). This program is mainly suited for Search and Rescue (SAR) applications, though it may be applied to other fields as well. UAV vehicles are assumed to have infinite battery life and instant acceleration, though this is not accurate to real life.
